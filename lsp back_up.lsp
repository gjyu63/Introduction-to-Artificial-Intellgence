; function BFS (FRINGE: list): list
; returns  list
;
; Description:
;  this function uses the breadth first search
;  to generate a flattened list
;  the argument FRINGE here is working as a FIFO queue 
(defun BFS (FRINGE)
  (cond 
    ((null FRINGE) nil)
    ((atom (car FRINGE)) (cons (car FRINGE) (BFS (cdr FRINGE))))
    (T (BFS (append (cdr FRINGE) (car FRINGE))))
    ))

; These functions implement a depth-first solver for the homer-baby-dog-poison
; problem. In this implementation, a state is represented by a single list
; (homer baby dog poison), where each variable is T if the respective entity is
; on the west side of the river, and NIL if it is on the east side.
; Thus, the initial state for this problem is (NIL NIL NIL NIL) (everybody 
; is on the east side) and the goal state is (T T T T).

; The main entry point for this solver is the function DFS, which is called
; with (a) the state to search from and (b) the path to this state. It returns
; the complete path from the initial state to the goal state: this path is a
; list of intermediate problem states. The first element of the path is the
; initial state and the last element is the goal state. Each intermediate state
; is the state that results from applying the appropriate operator to the
; preceding state. If there is no solution, DFS returns NIL.
; To call DFS to solve the original problem, one would call 
; (DFS '(NIL NIL NIL NIL) NIL) 
; However, it should be possible to call DFS with a different initial
; state or with an initial path.

; First, we define the helper functions of DFS.

; FINAL-STATE takes a single argument S, the current state, and returns T if it
; is the goal state (T T T T) and NIL otherwise.
