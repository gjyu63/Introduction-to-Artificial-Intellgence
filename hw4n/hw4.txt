1. In graph 1, when the number of colors is 3, it is unsatisfiable

when the number of colors is 4, it is satisfiable. 

2. 

The result shows that the minimum number of colors should be applied is 4, which also indicates that 
when the number of colors is greater than 4, it will be still satisfied.

So we can use 4 colors to solve that graph.

A possible solution of graph 1 is

node - color

       1 - 1
       2 - 2
       3 - 1
       4 - 4
       5 - 3 
       6 - 2
       7 - 3


3. In graph 2, when # of colors = 3,4,5,6,7, it is not satisfiable; when # >= 8, it will be satisfiable
